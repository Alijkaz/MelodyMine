# Your MySQL database configuration must strictly correspond with the database configuration in your
# '.env' file located in the 'web/docker/.env' directory.
#
# Similar values in the '.env' file:
# DATABASE_HOST => 'host'
# DATABASE_PORT => 'port'
# DATABASE_USERNAME => 'username'
# DATABASE_PASSWORD => 'password'
# DATABASE_NAME => 'database'
#
# Note: If you intend to utilize the 'authme' feature of 'melodymine',
# it is imperative that the 'authme' table and the 'melodymine' table reside in the same database.
